# Ecological_Statistics_Demos
This repository is a living collection of 'client-facing' and 'colleague-facing' \
RMarkdown documents that demonstrate ecological modeling techniques using simulated \
data. The 'colleague-facing' documents show how I would approach collaboration with \
other quantitative ecologists and statisticians, and the 'client-facing' documents \
show how I would approach communication with clients in a consulting context.
